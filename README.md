# Javs_Bank

# General Idea:
  Using C++, create a bank system and interface where the users are able to sign in, login, 
  deposit, withdraw, check balance, among other functions.

# Purpose:
  This is my first project using C++ (and my first project at all). For some reason, I find super
  interesting to develop a bank system and interface (maybe because I just like the name of my 
  fictional bank).
  
# Initial Functions:
  I'm still learning to code (College student majoring in SE. This is my first semester and I advanced in the book
  because the professor is going too slow, honestly). So, the functions will be upgraded at the same time my knowledge
  in this programming language++. (Did you understand the reference? lol).
  
    - Login or sign up. 
    - Deposit.
    - Withdraw.
    - Check balance.
